Advantages of using OO
1. Classes and OOPs written, are better to understand.
2. It is easy to modify and maintain

Advantages of using Dictionaries
1. Dictionaries allow unique key values.
2. It improves readability of the code.

Disadvantage of using OO

2. It is difficult to get adapted to.

Disadvantage of using dictionaries
1. Dictionaries are unordered.
2. They take up more space.

Performance comparison for grading operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N: 20
2. Time by OO: 0.005092144012451172
3. Time by dictionary: 0.000145272912638756
4. X is faster; fraction of time x took is: 0.005273739682937292

Performance comparison for search operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much).
1. N: 10
